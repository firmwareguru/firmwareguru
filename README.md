### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an embedded systems firmware guru specializing in using **STM32** to sense, connect and push the boundaries of what's possible.

I've done a lot of things in my career so far and I'm just getting started.  One highlight includes an end-to-end **sensor-to-blockchain** platform called [Measurement{Earth}](https://www.measurement.earth/).
