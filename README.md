### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an embedded systems firmware guru specializing in using **STM32** to sense, connect and push the boundaries of what's possible.

I've done a lot of things in my career so far and I'm just getting started.  One highlight includes an end-to-end **sensor-to-blockchain** platform called [Measurement{Earth}](https://www.measurement.earth/).

I'm building a firmware foundation upon which every single IoT device on the planet can operate on, starting with the firmware management system (bootloader and firmware  update system) I call the [stm32-secure-patching-bootloader](https://github.com/firmwaremodules/stm32-secure-patching-bootloader). Upon this foundation I'm working to enable the Measurement{Earth} IoT Operating System for general release.
